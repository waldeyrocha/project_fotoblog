# Hi, I'm Waldey! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a Fotoblog website, showcasing a gallery of images with their respective details. It is built using HTML, CSS, and Google Fonts.

## ðŸ›  Skills
HTML, CSS

## Getting Started

To view the Fotoblog website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Dependencies
The Fotoblog website uses Google Fonts to apply the "Mulish" font family. There are no other external dependencies.

## Usage
Upon opening the website, you will see a header with a logo and navigation links. The active page is indicated with a distinct color. The header also contains a search input to search for images and collections.

Scrolling down, you will find the main section with the gallery. Each item in the gallery displays an image, a title, and tags. When hovering over an image, it will slightly increase in size and gain a color effect.

The footer displays a copyright notice.

## Styles
The project uses CSS for styling, and it defines a set of CSS variables for colors and font sizes. The header and footer have animations that make them slide in from the top and bottom, respectively. The gallery items have a delay animation effect, making them appear one after another.

## Credits
The images used in the gallery are fetched from Unsplash random image URLs.
